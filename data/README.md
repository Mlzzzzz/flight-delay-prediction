# Data

## Flight Data

Our flight data is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielluizone/us-domestic-flights-delay-prediction-2013-2018

The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle, as part of the AWS Academy's Machine Learning Foundations course. This comprehensive dataset, titled "US Domestic Flights Delay Prediction (2014 - 2018)," was compiled by the Office of Airline Information, under the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). It includes data on scheduled and actual departure and arrival times, reported by certified US air carriers that account for at least one percent of domestic scheduled passenger revenues. The dataset contains extensive details on flight dates, times, origins, destinations, airlines, distance, and delay status.

## Weather Data

Our weather data is from: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/

Additional weather data were integrated from NOAA's Climate Data Online service, which offers free access to a global archive of historical weather and climate data. These data were specifically collected from weather stations at each of the main airports involved in the study, enhancing the dataset with hourly measurements of temperature, precipitation, wind, weather conditions, and other climatic variables relevant to flight delay predictions.
