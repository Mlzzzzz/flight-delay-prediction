# Data

Our data is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielluizone/us-domestic-flights-delay-prediction-2013-2018

This data was collected by the US Office of Airline Information and the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and it is data about flights from 2014 to 2018, including date, time, origin, destination, airline, and flight delay status. We combined this information with weather data at the same airport and when the flight was supposed to take off. We also combined this with information about whether the day the flight is on is a US holiday or before a holiday. 
The flight data was split into multiple CSV files, one for each month of each year. The weather data is from NOAA weather stations at each airport and the holiday information was added by each national holiday in the US.
